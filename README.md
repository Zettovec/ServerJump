# ServerJump
ServerJump plugin allows you to send players accross servers in BungeeCord.

### How to install?
1. Put your <a href="https://github.com/Zettovec/ServerJump/releases/">.jar file</a> into the your server's `plugins/` folder. (Not BungeeCord.)
2. **Restart your server!** (I do not recommend using PlugMan or /reload)
3. Plugin is ready to be used!

### How to use?
- Use command `/jump <player> <server>` from your server's console (Not BungeeCord.)

#### Skript Addon
Do you use Skript to develop your own plugins? I am working on a Skript addon for this plugin.
